## Implementation approach
We will use Flask for the backend, which is a lightweight and powerful Python web framework. For the frontend, we will use HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript. For the course creation interface, we will use a WYSIWYG editor like CKEditor, which is an open-source rich text editor. We will also use jQuery UI for the drag-and-drop features. For the database, we will use SQLAlchemy, which is a SQL toolkit and ORM for Python. We will use Bootstrap for responsive design. The difficult points will be the integration of these technologies and ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Data structures and interface definitions
```mermaid

    class User{
        +int id
        +str username
        +str email
        +str password
        +list courses
        +__init__(username: str, email: str, password: str)
        +add_course(course: Course)
        +remove_course(course: Course)
    }
    class Course{
        +int id
        +str title
        +str description
        +list content
        +User creator
        +__init__(title: str, description: str, creator: User)
        +add_content(content: Content)
        +remove_content(content: Content)
    }
    class Content{
        +int id
        +str title
        +str body
        +Course course
        +__init__(title: str, body: str, course: Course)
    }
    User "1" -- "*" Course: creates
    Course "1" -- "*" Content: contains
```

## Program call flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant M as Main
    participant U as User
    participant C as Course
    participant Co as Content
    M->>U: create user
    U->>M: return user
    M->>U: login user
    U->>M: return user
    M->>C: create course
    C->>M: return course
    U->>C: add course
    C->>U: update user
    M->>Co: create content
    Co->>M: return content
    C->>Co: add content
    Co->>C: update course
    M->>U: logout user
    U->>M: end session
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me.
