## Logic Analysis
```python
[
    ("config.py", "Contains the configuration settings for the application."),
    ("models.py", "Contains the User, Course, and Content classes. Should be implemented first as other files depend on it."),
    ("main.py", "Contains the main logic of the application. Depends on models.py."),
    ("views.py", "Contains the views for the application. Depends on models.py and main.py."),
    ("templates/index.html", "Contains the HTML for the index page. Depends on views.py."),
    ("templates/course.html", "Contains the HTML for the course page. Depends on views.py."),
    ("templates/profile.html", "Contains the HTML for the profile page. Depends on views.py."),
    ("static/css/main.css", "Contains the CSS for the application. Can be implemented independently."),
    ("static/js/main.js", "Contains the JavaScript for the application. Depends on the HTML templates.")
]
```

## Task list
```python
[
    "models.py",
    "config.py",
    "main.py",
    "views.py",
    "templates/index.html",
    "templates/course.html",
    "templates/profile.html",
    "static/css/main.css",
    "static/js/main.js"
]
```

## Shared Knowledge
```python
"""
'config.py' contains the configuration settings for the application, such as the database URI.
'models.py' contains the User, Course, and Content classes. These classes are used throughout the application.
'main.py' contains the main logic of the application, such as creating and logging in users, and creating courses and content.
'views.py' contains the views for the application. These views render the HTML templates and pass them the necessary data.
The HTML templates in the 'templates' directory use the data passed to them by the views to render the pages of the application.
The CSS in 'static/css/main.css' styles the HTML templates.
The JavaScript in 'static/js/main.js' adds interactivity to the HTML templates.
"""
```

## Anything UNCLEAR
The requirement is clear to me. The main entry point of the application is 'main.py'. All third-party libraries are initialized in 'main.py'.
